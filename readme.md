# Node JS Audacity Connector

This provides a class that will use named pipes to connect to audacity from node JS to run commands. It is currently optimized for WINDOWS (not linux or mac (PRs welcome)).

## Usage: 

For using the example script you can run it like this (after moving myaudio.wav into the current folder)

`node .\examplescript.mjs myaudio.wav myaudiooutpui.wav`
